            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A version control system is a way of tracking changes to one’s code – and is most useful in scenarios where multiple programmers are concurrently working on one project. Every time a change is added to the repository it is committed and saved as a unique version. Versions are easily comparable within the repository, so multiple contributors can troubleshoot one another’s code with ease. The ability to version control is important for instances where revisions need to be made in response to issues that are occurring in a system, so that the whole thing does not collapse. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A method is one or more lines of code that are designed to perform a particular task. It is essentially a function with a very "primitive"/very defined task. They can be pre-written and applied to code after, which is very useful since one programmer, especially a beginner, can not be expected to perfectly apply enumerable concepts without at least the option to cross-reference material with other user's methods.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Github Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are many commands that can be applied in Git that grant the programmer extensive flexibility. The "clone" command for example makes a copy of the repository that will live on your computer instead of online. The "Commit" command is one that is like saving a file, except in Git every time you save it creates a unique ID. "Pushing" is when one sends comitted changes to a remote repository, like one on Github or Cloud9.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">What IS a string?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A string is a store of any sequence of alphanumeric spaces, characters, and special characters. A string is generally considered a data type and is often implemented as an array data structure of bytes that stores a sequence of elements. The special characters that they can use are are symbols that have a "special" built-in meaning in the language and typically cannot be used in identifiers. For example, "/b" is backspace in Java.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">For most of its lifetime, changes to it were passed around as patches and archived files between programmers. In 2002, they began using a proprietary DVCS called BitKeeper. However In 2005, the relationship between the original community and the commercial company that developed BitKeeper broke down, and the tool’s free-of-charge status was revoked. This prompted the community to leave, and develop their own system, Git.</p>
